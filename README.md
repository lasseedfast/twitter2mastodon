Simple script to find out if Twitter accounts one is following are on Mastodon. Identifying mastodon handles from Twitter accounts' bio, adding them to a CSV file, uploading that file to Dropbox and then answering with a link to a shared Dropbox file.

_To run this you need:_
- [Twitter API credentials](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)
- [Dropbox API credentials](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/)

The project is in development and I will fill out this readme later.
